# EPAi3.0 Session10 Tuples \& Named Tuples Assignment
Assignment to check our knowledge of Tuples and Named Tuples.

1. Use the Faker (Links to an external site.)library to get 10000 random profiles. Using namedtuple, calculate the largest blood type, mean-current_location, oldest_person_age, and average age (add proper doc-strings). - 250 (including 5 test cases)
2. Do the same thing above using a dictionary. Prove that namedtuple is faster. - 250 (including 5 test cases)
3. Create fake data (you can use Faker for company names) for imaginary stock exchange for top 100 companies (name, symbol, open, high, close). Assign a random weight to all the companies. Calculate and show what value the stock market started at, what was the highest value during the day, and where did it end. Make sure your open, high, close are not totally random. You can only use namedtuple. - 500  (including 10 test cases)
4. Please write a readme file that can help me understand your code. If you don't write a readme properly, I would not be evaluating that piece of the code. 
5. Add the notebook as well to your github where logs can be visible. Your github code must have cleared all the 20 tests that you're writing (these 20 cannot be any of the ones you can already find in the code we shared earlier).
